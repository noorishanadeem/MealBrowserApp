Was unable to push some files/folders into my git repo due to them being to large. 
I forgot to do regular commits and tried to push up all the code at once in the end. 
I added in which I couldve, I will attach a compressed zip folder containing everything.
I hope you understand and this wont dock me marks.
Thank you
